# VoteOnMinecraftServer

Not the best but it works :)

Basic bot to go from google to desired server and voting on it.

# Cons:

1. Only usable one time every 24 hours.
2. Basic not the best may be filled with lines of code that could be better.
3. reCaptcha might be clicked without needing to solve it (if lucky) if not just solve it.

# Pros:

1. The best (for me that is).
2. Comments will guide through the code (writen in english).

# How to use it

1. Update the webDrivers if outdated.
2. Change the minecraft server in "M Craft" website if wanted.
3. Change username or leave it
4. Run in main java folder or test java folder.
5. Solve reCaptcha if not lucky
6. Thank you for the vote
